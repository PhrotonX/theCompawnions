                            Adopting a companion animal such as a dog or cat is a meaningful and rewarding   experience. More than just taking home a pet, adoption is an act of compassion and responsibility that gives abandoned and rescued animals a second chance at life. In the Philippines, thousands of cats and dogs are rescued every year from the streets, abusive homes, or illegal trading. Many of them are housed in shelters and foster homes, waiting for someone to give them the loving family they deserve. Understanding the process, responsibilities, and long-term commitment involved is crucial before making the decision to adopt.

                                <li><p>Make sure you are committed to taking care of a pet in the long-term and understand and can fulfil their needs.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Think about your lifestyle and what <a href="https://www.four-paws.org/our-stories/publications-guides/what-pet-best-suits-my-lifestyle" target="_blank">characteristics you are looking for in a pet.</a></p></li>
                                <li><p>Ensure that you find a <a href="https://www.four-paws.org/campaigns-topics/topics/companion-animals/adoption/what-makes-a-good-shelter" target="_blank">reputable shelter</a> or rehoming organisation who will give you lots of support and advice.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Be prepared to invest in your pet - veterinary care, equipment, food, and training <a href="https://www.four-paws.org/our-stories/publications-guides/financial-aspects-of-pet-ownership" target="_blank">can be expensive.</a></p></li>
                                <li><p>Make sure that you and your chosen pet get to know each other and visit them more than once.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Ensure that your other pets (e.g. dogs) get along well with your chosen pet by taking them to the shelter.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Check that your home and your family are prepared for the arrival of your pet.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Be aware that you need patience. When your pet arrives, everything is new for them and they need time to settle in.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Bear in mind that it’s worth waiting for the right pet to come along. Don’t give up if you don’t find the 'perfect' pet right away.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Know that you will definitely feel good about the fact that you’ve given a pet a much-needed home!</p></li>
