                                        Thousands of years ago, these wildcats were likely drawn to human settlements

                                        Territorial boundaries are demarcated by adult cats via rubbing or marking with urine. Scent is
                                        produced by glands near the ears, neck, and back of the head, and is released by rubbing against
                                        an object. When a cat scratches something with its claws to sharpen them, scent is released via
                                        pedal glands. Sharpening claws on an object or rubbing against it are forms of gentle marking,
                                        whereas spraying is used to establish territorial boundaries. Males tend to make territories more
                                        often than females (<a href="https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Felis_catus/#27278F13-4E31-4DA7-A8DE-8F6AC004E21E" target="_blank">Alderton</a>, 2002).

                                        House cats sometimes mimic nursing by chewing or sucking on fabrics or other household items. This
                                        is considered a comfort-seeking behavior common in kittens but is rare in adults unless they are
                                        removed from their mother too early to be weaned. Adult sucking or chewing is found most commonly
                                        in Siamese or Burmese breeds and usually continues throughout the animal's life. This type of behavior
                                        has been likened to obsessive compulsive disorder in humans caused, in part, by a genetic predisposition.
                                        House cats with little access or exposure to plants often chew on plants inside the house, which may be
                                        a sign that the cat is craving plant matter or that their diet is fiber deficient (

                                        Certain behaviors can be a nuisance to humans if not stopped early on. Kitten behavior can often be
                                        aggressive as kittens are still learning behavioral patterns from their peers or family. If a kitten
                                        is raised in the absence of family or play mates the play aggression has a much higher chance of
                                        becoming more severe and permanent. Unprovoked aggression towards

                                        stimuli, such as seeing a bird or animal outside and the behavior is then redirected toward a person.
                                        Males often show more aggression toward each other than toward females ("Health Topics", 2011).

                                Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. Cats belong to the Eukarya domain because they possess cells
                                with a defined nucleus.

                                Cats belong to the Animalia kingdom, which includes all animals. This means they are multicellular,
                                rely on other organisms for food (heterotrophic), and have cells without cell walls. Unlike plants,
                                animals exhibit movement and complex behaviors, traits that are evident in cats.

                                The Chordata phylum includes animals that have a notochord (a flexible rod supporting the body) at
                                some stage of development. Cats belong to this group because they have a spinal cord and backbone,
                                which are essential for their agility and movement.

                                As mammals, cats share key traits such as:

                                <li><p><strong>Fur or hair</strong> – helps with insulation.</p></li>
                                <li><p><strong>Mammary glands</strong> – female cats produce milk to nurse their young.</p></li>
                                <li><p><strong>Live birth</strong> – unlike reptiles or birds, cats give birth to live kittens instead of laying eggs.</p></li>

                            <p>
                                The order Carnivora consists of meat-eating mammals, including cats, dogs,
                                bears, and weasels. Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they require a diet
                                primarily made of meat. Their sharp teeth, retractable claws, and keen senses
                                make them excellent hunters.

                                The Felidae family includes all cats, from tiny domestic breeds to large wild
                                species like lions and tigers. Key characteristics of this family include:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><p>Slender, muscular bodies built for stealth and speed.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Retractable claws that help with climbing and hunting.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Highly developed night vision for hunting in low-light conditions.</p></li>

                                The Felis genus consists of small wildcats and <em>domestic cats</em>. Unlike their larger
                                relatives in the Panthera genus (lions, tigers, leopards), members of the Felis
                                genus typically:
                            </p>

                                <li><p>Live alone rather than in prides or packs.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Have a smaller, more agile build suited for hunting small prey.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Communicate through meows and purring, unlike big cats that roar.</p></li>

                            <p>
                                The domestic cat (Felis catus) has adapted to living alongside humans for thousands
                                of years. Though they retain their hunting instincts, they have been selectively bred
                                for different appearances, temperaments, and behaviors. Domestic cats exhibit:
                            </p>
                            <ol>

                                The ways in which humans interact with cats have evolved over time. While cats
                                were once valued primarily for their hunting abilities, they are now seen as
                                beloved household pets and valued for their companionship. People turn to cats
                                for emotional support, comfort, and as a source of entertainment. This evolution
                                of the human-cat relationship has led to a better understanding of the many
                                benefits that cats can offer people.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Studies have shown that spending time with cats can reduce stress and anxiety,
                                lower blood pressure, and even improve mood. In addition, cats can provide a
                                sense of purpose and responsibility for their owners, as well as a source of
                                unconditional love and affection.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It’s clear that the relationship between humans and cats has come a long way
                                since the days of ancient Egypt. While their role as protectors of grain
                                stores may have been their original purpose, cats have evolved to become much
                                more than just pest control. They are now cherished members of many households 
                                and offer their owners a wide range of benefits beyond their hunting abilities.
