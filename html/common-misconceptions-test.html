                                Myth: Cats Are Aloof and Unfriendly
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                Truth: Cats often have a reputation for being independent and standoffish, but this is far from the truth. While cats may not express affection in the same way as dogs, they can be incredibly loving and attached to their owners. Many cats enjoy cuddling, sitting on laps, and following their humans around the house.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Why This Myth Exists: Cats are often more subtle in their displays of affection, preferring gentle head rubs or purring over wagging tails and excited jumps. People unfamiliar with feline behavior may misinterpret this as aloofness.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Debunked: Cats bond deeply with their owners and can show affection through grooming, slow blinks, and even bringing “gifts” like toys. Understanding a cat’s unique body language is key to recognizing their affection.

                                Myth: Dogs Only Wag Their Tails When They’re Happy
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                Truth: Tail wagging is often seen as a universal sign of a happy dog, but it’s more complex than that. Dogs use their tails to communicate a wide range of emotions, including fear, anxiety, aggression, and excitement.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Why This Myth Exists: Many people associate tail wagging with a friendly dog, especially when it’s combined with other positive body language like a relaxed posture.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Debunked: The position, speed, and direction of the wag can all indicate different emotions. For example, a slow, stiff wag with the tail held high can signal aggression, while a low, rapid wag usually indicates nervousness. It’s important to observe the whole body language of a dog to understand their true feelings.

                                Myth: Cats Always Land on Their Feet
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                Truth: While cats have a remarkable righting reflex that helps them twist their bodies in mid-air to land on their feet, this does not guarantee their safety. Cats can still sustain serious injuries from falls, especially from high places.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Why This Myth Exists: Cats’ agility and flexibility contribute to their reputation for always landing safely, but this ability has its limits.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Debunked: Falls from significant heights, known as “high-rise syndrome,” can lead to broken bones, internal injuries, or worse. It’s crucial to keep windows secured and provide safe perches for cats to minimize the risk of falls.

                                Myth: You Can’t Teach an Old Dog New Tricks
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                Truth: This saying has been used for years to suggest that older dogs are set in their ways and cannot learn new behaviors. However, dogs of any age can learn new tricks, commands, and routines with proper training and patience.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Why This Myth Exists: Older dogs may be slower to learn due to established habits or health issues, but this does not mean they are incapable of learning.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Debunked: With positive reinforcement and consistent training, older dogs can learn just as well as younger ones. In fact, training can be a great way to keep senior dogs mentally stimulated and engaged.

                                Myth: Cats Are Low-Maintenance Pets
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                Truth: Cats are often marketed as the perfect low-maintenance pet because they are more independent and don’t need daily walks like dogs. However, cats require just as much care and attention as any other pet.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Why This Myth Exists: Cats can entertain themselves and use a litter box, leading many to assume they don’t need as much interaction or maintenance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Debunked: Cats need regular grooming, playtime, mental stimulation, and veterinary care. They can suffer from boredom, anxiety, and health issues just like dogs, and they thrive on interaction and attention from their owners.
