                            <h2>Overview</h2>
                            <p>Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are <a href="https://kids.kiddle.co/Domestication" target="_blank">domesticated mammals</a>, not natural wild
                                animals. They were originally bred from wolves. Dogs are sometimes called
                                "canines," which comes from the Latin word for dog - canis. Sometimes
                                people also use "dog" to describe other canids, such as wolves.</p>
                            <p>A baby dog is called a pup or puppy. A dog is called a puppy until it is
                                about one year old. Domesticated dogs have been bred by humans for a long
                                time and were probably the first animals to be domesticated. Domesticated 
                                dogs eat both meat and vegetables, often mixed together with other ingredients
                                and sold in stores as dog food.</p>
                            <p>Today, some dogs are used as pets while others are used to help humans do their
                                work. Dogs are popular pets because they are usually playful, friendly, and
                                listen well to humans. Thirty million dogs in the United States are registered
                                as pets. Dogs are sometimes referred to as "man's best friend" because they
                                are kept as domestic pets and are usually loyal and like being around
                                humans. Dogs often have jobs, including police dogs, army dogs, service dogs,
                                fire dogs, messenger dogs, hunting dogs, herding dogs, or rescue dogs.</p>

                            <h2>History and Domestication</h2>
                            <p>All dogs descend from a species of wolf, but not the gray wolf (<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/gray-wolf" target="_blank">Canis lupus</a>),
                                like many people assume. In fact, DNA evidence suggests that the now-extinct
                                wolf ancestor to modern dogs was Eurasian. However, scientists are still
                                working to understand exactly what species gave rise to dogs. </p>
                            <p>When dogs broke off from their wild ancestors is also a matter of mystery,
                                but genetics suggest that it occurred between 15,000 and 30,000 years ago.</p>
                            <p>
                                While itâ€™s impossible to say exactly how a wild wolf species became a
                                domesticated dog, most scientists believe the process happened gradually
                                as wolves became more comfortable with humans. Perhaps wolves started
                                down this path simply by eating human scraps. Many generations later,
                                humans might have encouraged wolves to stay near by actively feeding them.
                                Later still, those wolves may have been welcomed into the human home and
                                eventually bred to encourage certain traits. All of this is thought to have
                                unfolded over thousands of years.
