                                    <p>Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are <a href="https://kids.kiddle.co/Domestication" target="_blank">domesticated mammals</a>, not natural wild
                                        animals. They were originally <a href="https://kids.kiddle.co/Artificial_selection" target="_blank">bred</a> from
                                        <a href="https://kids.kiddle.co/Wolf" target="_blank">wolves</a>. Dogs are sometimes called
                                        "canines," which comes from the <a href="https://kids.kiddle.co/Latin" target="_blank">Latin</a> word for dog -
                                        canis. Sometimes people also use "dog" to describe other
                                        <a href="https://kids.kiddle.co/Canids" target="_blank">canids</a>, such as

                                    <p>A baby dog is called a pup or puppy. A dog is called a puppy until it is
                                        about one year old. Domesticated dogs have been bred by humans for a long
                                        time and were probably the first animals to be domesticated. Domesticated 
                                        dogs eat both <a href="https://kids.kiddle.co/Meat">meat</a> and
                                        <a href="https://kids.kiddle.co/Vegetable" target="_blank">vegetables</a>, often mixed together with other ingredients
                                        and sold in stores as dog <a href="https://kids.kiddle.co/Food" target="_blank">food</a>.</p>
                                    <p>Today, some dogs are used as <a href="https://kids.kiddle.co/Pet" target="_blank">pets</a> while others are used to help humans do their
                                        work. Dogs are popular pets because they are usually playful, friendly, and
                                        listen well to humans. Thirty million dogs in the <a href="https://kids.kiddle.co/United_States" target="_blank">United States</a>
                                        are <a href="https://kids.kiddle.co/Register" target="_blank">registered</a>
                                        as <a href="https://kids.kiddle.co/Pet" target="_blank">pets</a>. Dogs are sometimes referred to as "man's best friend" because they
                                        are kept as domestic pets and are usually loyal and like being around
                                        humans. Dogs often have jobs, including <a href="https://kids.kiddle.co/Police_dog" target="_blank">police dogs</a>,

                                        <h3>History and Domestication</h3>
                                        <p>All dogs descend from a species of wolf, but not the gray wolf (<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/gray-wolf" target="_blank">Canis lupus</a>),
                                            like many people assume. In fact, DNA evidence suggests that the now-extinct
                                            wolf ancestor to modern dogs was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aao4776" target="_blank">Eurasian</a>.
                                            However, scientists are still
                                            working to understand exactly what species gave rise to dogs. </p>
                                        <p>When dogs broke off from their wild ancestors is also a matter of mystery,
                                            but genetics suggest that it occurred between 15,000 and 30,000 years ago.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            While itâ€™s impossible to say exactly how a wild wolf species became a
                                            domesticated dog, most scientists believe the process happened gradually
                                            as wolves became more comfortable with humans. Perhaps wolves started
                                            down this path simply by eating human scraps. Many generations later,
                                            humans might have encouraged wolves to stay near by actively feeding them.
                                            Later still, those wolves may have been welcomed into the human home and
                                            eventually bred to encourage certain traits. All of this is thought to have
                                            unfolded over thousands of years.

                                        <p>
                                            Domestic dogs are similar to their ancestors, <a href="https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Canis_lupus/" target="_blank">wolves</a>, in that they are both pack animals
                                            with a complex set of behaviors related to determining the dogs position in the social
                                            hierarchy and their mood. There is only one leader in a pack, and often there is a struggle
                                            between members of the pack to determine who the leader is. The struggle ends with one animal
                                            on top of the other, with the submissive animal lying on its back. The dominant animal places
                                            its paw on the chest of the submissive one, and until the submissive animal looks away from
                                            the eyes of the dominant animal, the struggle continues. As soon as the submissive animal
                                            averts his eyes, he has admitted defeat and the leader of the pack has been determined. Dogs
                                            exhibit characteristic postures that reveal their states of mind. The neutral position is
                                            when a dog is calmly observing things in the environment. The mouth of a dog in this position
                                            may be open or closed. In the alert position, the dog's mouth may be open or closed, depending
                                            on the excitement level and environmental temperature. The hairs along the back and shoulders
                                            may raise without any intent of the dog to attack. The dog has simply focused his attention on
                                            some object and is curious about it. Offensive threat posture: hair raised, teeth showing, nose
                                            wrinkled, and growling may be heard. The tail is upright, although it may be wagging. A dog in
                                            this stance is ready to attack. Defensive threat: although the dog may be growling and snarling,
                                            the ears are laid back, which is a sign of submission in normal dogs, and the tail is hanging
                                            down. Greetings: relaxed face, mouth slightly open, loosely pulled back ears, tail wagging. 
                                            his is the posture dogs assume when playing with family members or other dogs. Play invitation:
                                            lowered front part of body while keeping the rear end up. A dog may bark in this invitation to
                                            play, but it does not growl excessively. Submission: body low to the ground, as compact as
                                            possible. Ears are drawn back, tail is tucked tightly under the body. Submissive dogs pull the
                                            corners of their mouths back but do not show their teeth (submissive grin). Some submissive dogs
                                            assume the most vulnerable position known to dogs, lying on the backs, exposing their undersides.
                                            This position admits ultimate defeat in the struggle of dominance between dogs.

                                            Domestic dogs can be active at any time of the day or night. Feral domestic dogs maintain home
                                            ranges that they defend against others and may move around throughout the year.

                                    While dogs have taken on many serious and life-saving roles, their most
                                    cherished position remains that of a loyal companion. Today, millions
                                    of households around the world have dogs as family pets.

                                    Studies show that having a dog can reduce stress, lower blood pressure,
                                    and improve mental health.

                                    Many rescue dogs find new purpose as emotional support animals, helping owners
                                    cope with anxiety, PTSD, and depression.

                                    From ancient hunting partners to modern-day therapy animals, dogs have
                                    continually adapted to meet human needs. Their unwavering loyalty,
                                    intelligence, and versatility make them one of humanityâ€™s greatest
                                    companions.

                                    As we move forward, dogs will likely continue to take on new rolesâ€”perhaps
                                    in technology, medicine, or even space exploration. But one thing is
                                    certain: their place in human history is irreplaceable.
