                        <h2>How to Report Abuse</h2>
                        <p>
                            Animal cruelty remains a heartbreaking reality in many parts of the
                            Philippines. Every day, countless dogs and cats suffer from neglect,
                            abuse, and abandonment. Fortunately, the country has laws and organizations
                            dedicated to protecting animals and ensuring that violators are held
                            accountable. Knowing how to report animal abuse is a vital step toward 
                            creating a more compassionate society. The first step in reporting animal
                            abuse is to gather proper evidence, if it is safe to do so. This includes
                            taking clear photos or videos of the abuse or neglect. Documentation
                            should also <strong>include</strong> the location of the incident, the date and time it
                            occurred, and any additional context that may help investigators. If there
                            are witnesses, it is helpful to collect their names and contact information.
                            These details are crucial, as they strengthen the case and help authorities
                            take swift action.Once evidence has been secured, the next step is to
                            determine the type of abuse being reported. Common forms include physical
                            harm, starvation, abandonment, lack of shelter, and chaining animals in
                            cramped or unsanitary conditions. Illegal practices such as dogfighting
                            or the sale of dog and cat meat are also classified as animal cruelty under
                            Philippine law.
